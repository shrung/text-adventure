# text-adventure

This is a text-based adventure game created as a group project for a programming class.
With a few modifications, it could be the most ground-breaking RPG ever released.

Some details about the organization of the project can be found in Design.txt and Design.h
There is no guarantee that these original plans were not changed on the fly as code was actually written though...
